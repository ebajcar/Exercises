Preparation and the first twenty hours are critical to go from knowing nothing about a skill to knowing that you're good at it; that is about 20 hours, about 40 minutes a day every day for about a month. This is long enough to get through the initial uninteresting and frustrating phase of learning. 



The preparation involves

Decide exactly what you want. What is your goal? (grade is a measure, not a goal)
Deconstruct the skill
Research to understand how to self-correct as you practice.
Remove barriers to practice. 
Precommit to at least 20 hours of deliberate practice before you begin. 


To help you set goals, you have learning outcomes and class time; to get guidance what to research and how to deconstruct the skill(s), and help you with self-correction to keep you on track, you have course material and class activities. Deliberate practice cannot, and it is not meant to, take place in the classroom! 



The testing should reflect your mastery level as you practice over time. The teacherâ€™s feedback should validate or correct if you are straying.
